# Hello!

My name is Jack, and welcome to my personal site.

## a litle bit about me
- I'm from Vietnam. I speak Vietnamese (duh), English (fluent) and I'm also currently learning Japanese
- I'm a light novel, rhythm games and Formula One addict
- I'm a manga scanlator (JP/EN -> VN). Might enter the novel scene one day, not sure though
